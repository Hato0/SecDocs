#### Q65) What is Cyber Kill Chain?
The cyber kill chain is a process which defines primary steps of a cyber attack. Below is the 7 stages of cyber kill chain.

Reconnaissance- Passively( searching information on various search engines like google dork, shodan etc) gathering information about target.
Weaponization – Preparing remote access malware with an exploit into a deliverable payload.
Delivery – Transferring payload(any malicious application or script) to victims device by social engineering or by some other method.
Exploitation – Exploit vulnerable application to make use of delivered payload.
Installation – Installation of backdoor using payload for remote access.
Command & Control – After the successful installation of a backdoor device can be controlled remotely and various actions can be performed.( DDOS is the most common attack performed using CnC servers).
Actions on Objective – Attacker will work to achieve the objective for which attack is performed, which can include data exfiltration or destruction of data or attacking some other device.

#### Q73) What is a Firewall?
A firewall is the First level of security it monitors all the traffic coming to and leaving from the organization, using firewall unauthorized access, malicious source and network traffic can be controlled.

#### Q74) What is CIA triad in information security?
CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These are the 3 basic components for information security which stands to secure our data in an organization

Confidentiality – it ensures that the data should not be disclosed to unauthorized access, an attacker can breach confidentiality by network sniffing, shoulder surfing or stealing the password files during transmission of data. So, confidentiality can be provided by encrypting the data as it is stored or transmitted from client to server.
Integrity – It assures the accuracy and reliability of the information and prevents unauthorized modification. An attacker can insert a virus, backdoor or key logger into a system, so the system’s integrity can be compromised.
Availability – It ensures reliability and timely access to data and resource to authorized people, if resources is not available at the time when is required, it can lead to a huge business loss like which usually happen in DOS attack.


#### Q75) What is CSRF attack, and how can we mitigate this?
CSRF (Cross-site request forgery) is an attack where the attacker sends the legitimate request or HTML page to authenticate the user to perform some action inattentively. The only condition to perform this attack is a victim should be logged in.
We can mitigate is attack while implementing captcha in all form submitted pages and with CSRF token. And there is another option to mitigate this attack is implementing multi-factor authentication based on the criticality of the application.

#### Q76)  What is Cross-site scripting attack?
Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack is a type of client-side injection attack in which an attacker tries to inject malicious scripts to the legitimate web application. This attack will lead to disclosing cookie information, website defacement, etc.
There are 3 types of Cross-site scripting:

Reflected XSS – In this type of XSS, the request with malicious scripts send to server and reflected into theclient side.
Stored XSS – In this type of XSS, malicious scripts stored permanently in server and whenever any user accesses that particular application, malicious script executes.
DOM-based XSS – In this type of XSS, the request of the malicious script does not send to the server, it executes in theclient sideitself.


#### Q77) What are the cookie attributes used in a web application?
There are different types of cookies attributes:

HTTP-only – It blocks the client-side scripts to access the cookie.
Secure – Secure flag ensures the cookie will be sent from client to server through an encrypted channel.
Domain – The domain for which cookie is valid will submit with every request for the same domain and its sub-domain.
Path – The cookie should be valid for a particular URL or path.
Expires – It is used to set a persistent cookie and when the cookie should be expired.


#### Q78) Explain Heartbleed attack.
Heartbleed is the vulnerability in OpenSSL library, Heartbeat is a component of TSL/SSL protocol when any system sends an encrypted piece of data is called heartbeat request to other systems, the other system will also send an exact same encrypted piece of data to maintain the connection. Now the system which receives the data never checked the size of data which was claimed, so attacker increase the size of data lets say 64kb but actual size of data is 40kb, now the receiving system will send back the data of 64kb in which 24kb is plus size taking form memory buffer whatever happens in next 24kb memory. This extra 24kb data an attacker can extract from a web server. So this is the way we can exploit heartbleed attack.

#### Q79) If you get a login page web application, what are the things which can be performed?
In the login page web application, we can perform the following task:

1st we can try user enumeration, including observing the error getting from the application while giving input of wrong usernames and passwords.
We can perform SQL injection in all entry points.
We can perform Clickjacking.
We can try to login with default username and password
We can perform a Brute force attack to extract username and password.
Check for SSL certificate if the application is using weakly encrypted certificate, Man-in-the-middle attack can be performed.


#### Q80) Explain the difference between bind shell and reverse shell in Metasploit.
Bind and reverse shell are two different payloads which are used in Metasploit.
The basic difference between bind and reverse shell is, Bind shell uses when payload is sent in intranet for example, If an attacker is there in the same network, can send payload to anyone who has connected in same network and get access of their system, but Reverse shell payload used to access the system which has public IP and is there in internet and it is used to bypass firewall, get entered into any network and access the systems inside the particular network.

#### Q81) Explain the differences between encryption and hashing.
Encryption is a two-way process which is used to change the format of data from human-readable format to non-human readable format and vice-versa. we use some algorithm to encrypt the data.
Encryption also has two types:

Symmetric Encryption – In Symmetric encryption, we use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. Ex – 3DES, AES, RC4, etc
Asymmetric Encryption – In Asymmetric encryption, we use the public key to encrypt the data and private key to decrypt the data. Ex – RSA, DSA, etc.

Hashing is a unidirectional process which is used to store long string data in short length, mostly hashing algorithm uses to retrieve data in databases. Ex – MD5, SHA2, etc.

#### Q82) How can SQL injection be mitigated.
There is a different way to mitigate SQL injection

Using parameterized queries which forces the developer to define all sql codes and then passes in parameter to the queries.
keep up to date application server and database
Sanitize the inputs and keep input validation properly
Keep Web application firewall to filter malicious input


#### Q83) What is the difference between Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration testing.
Vulnerability Assessment is a process to identify the weaknesses and loopholes in the system, server or asset, mostly it is automated process which can be identified with different tools available in the market.
Penetration testing is a process to exploit the vulnerabilities which is identified in VA. It can be performed in both ways manual and automated, manually we can perform based on the information gathered of server details, versions framework etc.
